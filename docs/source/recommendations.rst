Recommendations and Best Practices
==================================

Getting started
---------------

Use the Tutorial notebooks. Note, the tutorials are all Jupyter Notebooks - they can be read online, though the readthedocs rendering is a bit awkward in parts - but they're really best used by downloading the
notebooks and running them locally. These will let you reproduce some of the results from the Direct Observations of Exoplanetary Systems ERS program.

Tuning and Improving Reductions for MIRI data
-----------------------------------------------

 - Understand whether your science and PSF stars are at similar or different exposure levels. If the PSF stars are much brighter than the science target, there may be detector nonlinearities, or issues in scaling the background subtraction. 
 - Look for multiple PSF references and assemble a PSF library
